{"questions":[{"id":36,"question":"What is port security?","answer":"Port security is a network security measure that limits and controls access to a network via the physical ports of a switch."},{"id":37,"question":"What are the main types of port security?","answer":"The main types of port security include static MAC address binding, dynamic MAC address learning, and sticky MAC address binding."},{"id":38,"question":"How does static MAC address binding work?","answer":"Static MAC address binding assigns a specific MAC address to a port manually, preventing any other devices from connecting to that port."},{"id":39,"question":"What is dynamic MAC address learning?","answer":"Dynamic MAC address learning allows the switch to learn MAC addresses dynamically, storing them in a table for access control based on a limit."},{"id":40,"question":"What is sticky MAC address binding?","answer":"Sticky MAC address binding allows the switch to learn dynamically but retains the learned addresses in NVRAM upon reboot."},{"id":41,"question":"What happens if a device with an unauthorized MAC address tries to connect?","answer":"If an unauthorized MAC address tries to connect, the port can be shut down, the MAC address can be added to a violation list, or traffic can be restricted based on configuration."},{"id":42,"question":"How can you view the port security settings on a switch?","answer":"Port security settings can typically be viewed through: 'show port-security', 'show running-config', or specific vendor commands like 'show port-security interface [interface]'."},{"id":43,"question":"What is the maximum number of MAC addresses a port can learn?","answer":"The maximum number of MAC addresses a port can learn is configurable; usually, it's set between 1 to 1024 depending on the switch's capabilities."},{"id":44,"question":"What is a violation mode in port security?","answer":"Violation mode determines the action taken when a security violation occurs, such as shutdown, restrict, or protect."},{"id":45,"question":"What does it mean when a port is in the shutdown state due to a security violation?","answer":"When a port is in the shutdown state, it is disabled and does not pass traffic until manually re-enabled by an administrator."},{"id":46,"question":"How can you re-enable a port shut down due to a security violation?","answer":"To re-enable a port, an administrator must enter the command to shut it down and then re-enable it manually."},{"id":47,"question":"What commands are used to configure port security on a Cisco switch?","answer":"Commands used to configure port security include 'switchport port-security', 'switchport port-security maximum [number]', 'switchport port-security violation [mode]', and 'switchport port-security mac-address [address]'."},{"id":48,"question":"Can port security be configured on trunk ports?","answer":"Port security can be configured on trunk ports, but care must be taken since multiple VLANs can complicate MAC address binding."},{"id":49,"question":"What is the difference between a sticky MAC and a static MAC?","answer":"Sticky MAC addresses are learned and saved across reboots, while static MAC addresses are manually configured and always preserved."},{"id":50,"question":"How does port security help prevent MAC flooding attacks?","answer":"Port security limits the number of MAC addresses allowed on a port, thus mitigating MAC flooding attacks where an attacker sends numerous MAC addresses to exhaust the switch's MAC address table."},{"id":51,"question":"What should be monitored to ensure port security is functioning properly?","answer":"Monitoring the MAC address table, checking violation logs, and using commands like 'show port-security interface' help ensure port security is functioning correctly."},{"id":52,"question":"What role does the CAM table play in port security?","answer":"The Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table stores the MAC addresses learned by the switch and is integral for enforcing port security rules."},{"id":53,"question":"How often should port security configurations be reviewed?","answer":"Port security configurations should be reviewed regularly, ideally as part of routine network audits or when network changes are made."},{"id":54,"question":"What are the best practices for implementing port security?","answer":"Best practices include configuring a maximum number of addresses, using sticky MAC addresses when possible, and monitoring logs for violations."},{"id":55,"question":"What are the risks of not implementing port security?","answer":"Not implementing port security can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and increased vulnerability to attacks such as MAC flooding."}]}
